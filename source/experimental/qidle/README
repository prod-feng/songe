The qidle utility watches the interactive X load. It checks for special XEvents.

To be able to access the Xserver, the Xsession file must contain the following two lines in order to get access to the Xsession.

#
# qidle specific settings
#
xauth extract /tmp/.grd_xauthority ${SESSION_SVR}:0
chmod 400 /tmp/.grd_xauthority
